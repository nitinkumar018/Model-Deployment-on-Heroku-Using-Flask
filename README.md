# Project: Build a linear regression model to predict the salary and deploy the model in Heroku using flask 
## model.pkl: it is pickle file which is having our entire linear regression algorithm 
## app.py: it has code for creating web app using flask library (back end web development)
## index.html: it has code for buttons for inserting input and see the output (front end web application)
## style.css: it shows how to display the HTML file when it is rendered on the web browser
## request.py: it has code for url 

## configuration files: Procfile.txt, gitignore.txt, requirements.txt
### Procfile: it tells the Heroku environment which is the first file you have to execute and this file is app.py
### requirements.txt: it has all the libraries that need to be installed in my Heroku environment 
### gitignore.txt: it has all the files that are not required to be pushed into the Git repository. Hence, it increases the security of your application. 

## Connect Github repository to my Heroku account to upload all the files to my Heroku environment. It will give URL extension (web app) which is applicable globally
## Check logs(errors) on Heroku CLI (Command Line Interface)
